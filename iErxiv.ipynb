From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope.

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\\\\\\\\sim$0.02.

In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\\\\\\\\rm{bin}}=4\\\\\\\\,M_\\\\\\\\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39\\\\\" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\\\\u03b1$ emission at 0.20\\\\\" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\\\\\\\\sim0.1\\\\u0394\\\\\\\\upsilon_{\\\\\\\\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk\\'s underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.\",\\n      \"categories\": [\\n        \"astro-ph.EP\",\\n        \"astro-ph.GA\",\\n        \"astro-ph.SR\"\\n      ],\\n      \"published\": \"2026-01-21T18:45:10+00:00\",\\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15262v1\",\\n      \"resource_uri\": \"arxiv://2601.15262v1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"2601.15253v1\",\\n      \"title\": \"QDK/Chemistry: A Modular Toolkit for Quantum Chemistry Applications\",\\n      \"authors\": [\\n        \"Nathan A.

The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.\",\\n      \"categories\": [\\n        \"quant-ph\",\\n        \"physics.chem-ph\",\\n        \"physics.comp-ph\"\\n      ],\\n      \"published\": \"2026-01-21T18:35:40+00:00\",\\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15253v1\",\\n      \"resource_uri\": \"arxiv://2601.15253v1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"2601.15250v1\",\\n      \"title\": \"FlowSSC: Universal Generative Monocular Semantic Scene Completion via One-Step Latent Diffusion\",\\n      \"authors\": [\\n        \"Zichen Xi\",\\n        \"Hao-Xiang Chen\",\\n        \"Nan Xue\",\\n        \"Hongyu Yan\",\\n        \"Qi-Yuan Feng\",\\n        \"Levent Burak Kara\",\\n        \"Joaquim Jorge\",\\n        \"Qun-Ce Xu\"\\n      ],\\n      \"abstract\": \"Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.\",\\n      \"categories\": [\\n        \"cs.CV\",\\n        \"cs.RO\"\\n      ],\\n      \"published\": \"2026-01-21T18:32:27+00:00\",\\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15250v1\",\\n      \"resource_uri\": \"arxiv://2601.15250v1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"2601.15247v1\",\\n      \"title\": \"Taxonomy-Aligned Risk Extraction from 10-K Filings with Autonomous Improvement Using LLMs\",\\n      \"authors\": [\\n        \"Rian Dolphin\",\\n        \"Joe Dursun\",\\n        \"Jarrett Blankenship\",\\n        \"Katie Adams\",\\n        \"Quinton Pike\"\\n      ],\\n      \"abstract\": \"We present a methodology for extracting structured risk factors from corporate 10-K filings while maintaining adherence to a predefined hierarchical taxonomy. Our three-stage pipeline combines LLM extraction with supporting quotes, embedding-based semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and LLM-as-a-judge validation that filters spurious assignments. To evaluate our approach, we extract 10,688 risk factors from S&P 500 companies and examine risk profile similarity across industry clusters. Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen\\'s d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p<0.001). The methodology generalizes to any domain requiring taxonomy-aligned extraction from unstructured text, with autonomous improvement enabling continuous quality maintenance and enhancement as systems process more documents.\",\\n      \"categories\": [\\n        \"cs.CL\"\\n      ],\\n      \"published\": \"2026-01-21T18:28:31+00:00\",\\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15247v1\",\\n      \"resource_uri\": \"arxiv://2601.15247v1\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}', 'id': 'lc_49f26bb8-4f2d-4ced-844b-629a50fcf0c7'}], name='search_papers', id='6e5b8970-99d4-47c8-8875-e5851a3f4101', tool_call_id='call_00_fKu8ZGx9Z8AM8afllDJh5izL')]}\n"

The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase.

This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels.

Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode.

      "Interaction-induced single-particle band instability couples extended and localized states, unexpectedly enhancing many-body localization in a generalized Aubry-Andre model.A many-body localization-based calibration scheme mitigates crosstalk and residual coupling errors in superconducting qubits by leveraging disorder-induced localization to enhance fidelity and stability with reduced computational overhead.Floquet scar states engineered in a generalized PXP model via an $SO(3)$-FSA approach generate subharmonic responses that persist beyond the prethermalization regime.A fiber array architecture enables fully independent, high-fidelity control of individual atoms in optical tweezers by using a common waveguide for each atom's trapping and addressing lasers to suppress beam pointing noise.A cryogenic-compatible PDMS stamp enables in-situ three-dimensional strain control of quantum dots in photonic structures to tune emission energy and eliminate fine structure splitting for scalable quantum networks.Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation stabilizes a disorder-free discrete time crystal in a kicked XXZ spin chain, enabling a robust subharmonic response with a lifetime growing exponentially with system size.A hybrid lithium niobate-GaAs platform enables dynamic exceptional point engineering to reversibly modulate quantum emitter lifetimes and generate non-Lorentzian single-photon spectra via cavity local density of states control.A cold atom gyroscope was successfully demonstrated in space for the first time using a dual-atom-interferometer on the China Space Station, achieving high-resolution rotation measurements by compensating the station's rotation with a self-calibrated piezoelectric mirror and correcting systemic effects.A many-body mobility edge is ruled out at infinite temperature for generic noninteracting fermions, proven by demonstrating their many-body spectrum and conserved quantities follow a multivariate normal distribution vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of a single-particle mobility edge.Nonsymmorphic dynamical symmetry enforces a discrete time crystal phase by inducing Möbius-twisted eigenstates that yield exact, stable subharmonic responses and a π Berry phase without superposition for specific drives, even with many-body interactions.An unsupervised learning analysis of eigenstate entanglement spectra reveals the non-ergodic extended regime is a dependent crossover, not an independent phase, as it exhibits hybrid characteristics of both many-body localized and thermal regimes.The core contribution is analytically relating out-of-time-order correlators in chaotic quantum circuits to the singular values of light-like generators, deriving universal decay forms from sub-leading eigenvalues, and proposing conjectures on eigenvalue degeneracies based on the recursive structure of these generators.A mean-field treatment of a driven, dissipative macrospin system in the thermodynamic limit yields classical equations of motion whose chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases, characterized by Lyapunov exponents, converge with finite-size quantum dynamics up to the Lyapunov time only when the quantum density matrix is sharply localized.After refining 13 papers concurrently...\n",

    "- **Full Summary**: Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.\n",

After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.\n",

    "- **Full Summary**: We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $η_{\\text{enh}} \\propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $δ= 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2π\\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities.

Due to the excitation of surface plasmons induced by graphene in low terahertz frequency range, there exist the resonant transmission and anomalous Goos-Hänchen shifts in such optical tunneling configuration. As compared to the case of quantum well, graphene sheet with unique optical properties can enhance the resonant transmission with relatively low loss, and modulate the large negative and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts by adjusting chemical potential or electron relaxation time.

For a systems of bosons, an example of strong correlations manifesting themselves in a 2D environment is provided by helium adsorbed on graphene. We construct the effective Bose-Hubbard model for this system which involves hard-core bosons $(U\\\\approx\\\\infty)$, repulsive nearest-neighbor $(V&gt;0)$ and small attractive $(V\\'&lt;0)$ next-nearest neighbor interactions. The mapping onto the Bose-Hubbard model is accomplished by a variety of many-body techniques which take into account the strong He-He correlations on the scale of the graphene lattice spacing. Unlike the case of dilute ultracold atoms where interactions are effectively point-like, the detailed microscopic form of the short range electrostatic and long range dispersion interactions in the helium-graphene system are crucial for the emergent Bose-Hubbard description. The result places the ground state of the first layer of $^4$He adsorbed on graphene deep in the commensurate solid phase with $1/3$ of the sites on the dual triangular lattice occupied. Because the parameters of the effective Bose-Hubbard model are very sensitive to the exact lattice structure, this opens up an avenue to tune quantum phase transitions in this solid-state system.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.mes-hall\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2021-02-22T19:00:04Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>22 pages, 18 figures.

Conventional numerical simulation methods either approximate them as being coupled to a particle bath, or use projective algorithms which may suffer from non-optimal scaling with system size or large algorithmic prefactors. In this paper, we introduce a highly stable, recursive Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo approach that can directly simulate systems in the canonical ensemble. We apply the method to the fermion Hubbard model in one and two spatial dimensions in a regime known to exhibit a significant \"sign\" problem and find improved performance over existing approaches including rapid convergence to ground state expectation values. The effects of excitations above the ground state are quantified using an estimator-agnostic approach including studying the temperature dependence of the purity and overlap fidelity of the canonical and grand canonical density matrices. As an important application, we show that thermometry approaches often exploited in ultra-cold atoms that employ an analysis of the velocity distribution in the grand canonical ensemble may be subject to errors leading to an under-estimation of extracted temperatures with respect to the Fermi temperature.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.str-el\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"nucl-th\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"physics.atom-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"physics.chem-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2022-12-16T18:59:40Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>14 pages, 7 figures, and Supplemental Information with key derivations.

In this study, we explore the effects of graphene corrugation on the helium adsorption process via quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. We utilize an empirical adsorption potential based on the superposition of individual helium-carbon interactions and systematically control corrugation, from a smooth membrane to the fully rough potential, via the implementation of a cutoff in reciprocal space. The results highlight the importance of using a fully corrugated potential to understand the plethora of commensurate and incommensurate phases in the first adsorbed layer. Surprisingly, some residual effects of corrugation are still present before and during the promotion and onset of a second adsorbed layer, where a smooth adsorption can lead to enhanced particle fluctuations in a helium-interaction dominated regime.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.mes-hall\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2023-11-21T17:42:33Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>12 pages, 8 figures (added additional system sizes).

We present proof-of-principle calculations, and benchmark against an exactly soluble model of interacting bosons in one spatial dimension. As this algorithm retains the fundamental polynomial scaling of quantum Monte Carlo when applied to sign-problem-free models, future applications should allow for the study of entanglement entropy in large scale many-body systems of interacting bosons.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"quant-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2014-04-28T19:25:04Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>19 pages, 13 figures; updated figures, fixed typos, and fixed notational inconsistencies</arxiv:comment>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\"/>\\n    <arxiv:journal_ref>Phys.

Using ground state path integral quantum Monte Carlo we numerically compute the R\\xc3\\xa9nyi entropy of the reduced density matrix of the subsystem as a measure of entanglement. Our numerical algorithm is based on a replica method previously introduced by the authors, which we extend to efficiently study the entanglement of spatial subsystems of itinerant bosons. We confirm a logarithmic scaling of the R\\xc3\\xa9nyi entropy with subsystem size that is expected from conformal field theory, and compute the non-universal subleading constant for interaction strengths ranging over two orders of magnitude. In the strongly interacting limit, we find agreement with the known free fermion result.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"quant-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2016-06-10T17:10:36Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>14 pages, 11 figures</arxiv:comment>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\"/>\\n    <arxiv:journal_ref>Phys.

At small waiting times after the quench, we map the system to non-interacting bosons such that we are able to extract their occupation numbers from the Fourier transform of the density-density correlation function, and use these to compute a bosonic entropy from a diagonal ensemble. By comparing this bosonic entropy with the asymptotic steady state entanglement entropy per fermion computed with exact diagonalization we find excellent agreement.</summary>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.stat-mech\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cond-mat.quant-gas\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <published>2021-11-12T15:03:56Z</published>\\n    <arxiv:comment>7 pages, 4 figures.
